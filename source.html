&lt;!--Hello! If you're reading this, that means you've found the source code for my letter. If this is true, you're probably pretty cool. As I'm writing this, I'm pretty early on in my HTML "Career" (if you can even call it that), but I'm definitely going to try to keep going further. If you're also learning HTML, or are interested, feel free to email me.--&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Dear future students,&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey! I'm Talia, I'm 15 as of writing this, and I transferred into English 9 Enriched with Mr. Monette at the start of 2nd semester of the 2021-2022 school year. This letter isn't all about me though, since I'm supposed to be writing about Mr. Monette and his class. Honestly, Mr. Monette is a pretty cool guy, I've had actual conversations with him outside of just work, and it's obvious that he thinks more of me (and the rest of his students) than just a paycheck, which is really nice. I guess if I could give a piece of advice it's to not be afraid to talk to him if something's going on, especially if it's making it harder for you to work in his class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the course, my best advice is to just do the best you can when it comes to the assignments. It's not really his fault, but every assignment in Mr. Monette's class matters a lot, especially towards the end of the year. Take it from me, I didn't do well on my Romeo and Juliet essay in Quarter 3, and now my semester grade is down to around an 85, even with hard work in Quarter 4 to compensate. If it makes you feel better though, Mr. Monette loosens up a lot in fourth quarter, so you have something to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Also, I know I've already touched on it a bit, but if you'd like to outperform me, or like, make up for my missed potential or whatever, there's a few things I reccomend which I've listed below:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Keep on top of your assignments however you need to. Google calender, your planner, whatever works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; assignment, they all count towards your grade a lot. There are some which are more important than others, but try to do every one.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even if you transfer in like I did, try to talk to your classmates. Not even just in Mr. Monette's class, just in like, all of them, the easiest way to lose motivation to go to school is to not have friends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  Honestly, I tried to think of more things, but these are the most important ones. Just do them the best you can, and you should do decently well this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm also supposed to tell you about one thing I'll always remember from this class. This one was pretty hard to think of, honestly, but I'd say the thing I'll remember the most is my presentation from 4th quarter. Honestly, I did like, 95% of the project myself, even though I had a group, which isn't something I'd reccommend. It wasn't really their fault, since they didn't know much about the topic from the start as I did, plus I did things faster than they could keep up I think. Either way, take this as a word of advice, next time you have a group project, in Mr. Monette's or not, try to cooperate as much as you possbily can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm not usually bad at conclusions, but honestly this one's pretty hard. If I can leave you with one piece of advice, it's to not be afraid to reach out, it doesn't necessarily have to be to me (though it can be), but if you're struggling, try to talk to someone. It doesn't matter if it's academic or not, if you need help with something, at least try to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;With care,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
